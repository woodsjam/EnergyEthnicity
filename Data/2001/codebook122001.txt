          The variable DOEID will be on all files.  Each respondent is assigned
     an unique value of DOEID.  It can be used to merge data from one file

          The sample design for RECS is not a simple random sample.
     Consequently, to estimate the number or percent of households/housing units
     with a certain characteristic, the sampling weight should be used.  The
     variable NWEIGHT is the sampling weight for the observation.  It is
     approximately the inverse of the probability of selection.  It gives
     the number of households that the response represents in the sample. 
     For most categorical variables, the codebooks contain both the
     unweighted frequency and the weighted frequency.  The unweighted
     frequency gives the number of observations, the weighted frequency
     gives survey estimate of the number of households/housing units for
     each possible value of the variable.  The weighted frequencies are
     rounded to the nearest 100,000 households.  This is the limit of the
     accuracy for RECS.  When the unweighted frequency is less than 10 or
     the weighted frequency is less than 150,000; then weighted frequency is
     suppressed.  A 'Q' is placed in the frequency to denote that the number
     is suppressed.  This indicates that there are too few observation upon
     which to determine an accurate estimate.

     Q = Data withheld because fewer than 10 observation in the category.

          When MQRESULT equals 1 2, or 3, the household and housing unit data
     was not obtained via a personal interview.  The data were obtained using a
     shortened mail questionnaire.  A hot-deck imputation procedure was used
     to match each mail respondent to a personal interview respondent.  The
     critical matching variables were FUELHEAT, FUELH2O, TYPECOOL, TYPEHUQ,
     and REGIONC.  Additional  variables used in a scoring function to
     determine the best match were MONEYPY, NHSLDMEM, VEHICLES, HHAGE, and
     TOTROOMS.  The remaining household/housing unit characteristics for the
     mail respondents were determined by the values of the matched personal
     interview respondent.  The energy consumption and expenditures data for
     the mail respondents was based upon data obtained from their energy
     suppliers.  It was not imputed using a hot deck procedure.

          Questionnaire data from personal interview respondents sometime is
     missing and needs to be imputed.  'Z' variables are used to indicate
     the presence of imputed data.  For example, if ZURBRUR = 0 then URBRUR
     was not imputed.  If ZURBRUR = 1 then URBRUR was imputed.

was obtained.

          Cooling degree days are the number of degrees the average daily

     temperature (ADT) is above the base temperature.  Heating degree days
     are the number of degrees the ADT is below the base temperature.  To
     calculate daily degree days (base 65 degrees):



          ADT = (daily high + daily low)/2


          CDD(daily)     = 0            if ADT <= 65
                         = ADT - 65     if ADT > 65

          HDD(daily)     = 0            if ADT >= 65
                         = 65 - ADT     if ADT < 65.

          Annual degrees days are calculated by summing the daily degree days. 
     The .5 is carried over in the summation.  The total is rounded up after
     the summation.

     DOLLARLP is based upon one of the following:
          1.   Supplier data on the amount delivered to the household in
               2001.
          2.   Regression estimate.

          The 6 cases where USELP equals 1 and DOLLARLP equals 0 occur when the
     household uses LPG but did not report buying LPG in the 12 months prior
     to the interview or the supplier reported that they did not deliver LPG
     to the household during 2001.
  
The remaining variables are estimates of expenditures by end use.  

For each household that responded to the 2001 RECS, the annual energy
expenditures for five end-use categories-- space heating, water heating, air-
conditioning, refrigerators, and general appliance usage--were estimated. 
The end-use estimates were produced for each of the five main energy sources:
electricity, natural gas, fuel oil, kerosene, and liquefied petroleum gas
(LPG).  The end-use expenditures were not based on data produced by placing
meters on individual appliances; rather, they were obtained by estimating how
much of the total annual expenditures for each energy source can be
attributed to each of the end-use categories for each household by using a
regression technique.  

The regression technique was used to first estimate the percent of energy
consumption by energy source and end use.  Next these percents were used to
determine the corresponding amount spent on each end-use by each household.  

The end-use estimates were normalized so that the sum of the end-use
estimates was equal to the actual or imputed yearly expenditures for each
energy source used by the household.

In particular:
     DOLLAREL  = DOLELSPH + DOLELWTH + DOLELAPL + DOLELCOL + DOLELRFG
     DOLLARNG  = DOLNGSPH + DOLNGWTH + DOLNGAPL + DOLNGCOL
     DOLLARFO  = DOLFOSPH + DOLFOWTH + DOLFOAPL
     DOLLARLP  = DOLLPSPH + DOLLPWTH + DOLLPAPL
     DOLLARKR  = DOLKRSPH + DOLKRWTH + DOLKRAPL

For all energy sources, the space-heating component was defined as all energy
used to generate heat by space-heating equipment.  The equipment could be the
main space-heating equipment or secondary space-heating equipment.  Hence,
for all energy sources, a household could have had a positive amount of
energy assigned to the space-heating component even if the energy source was
not used as the main space-heating energy source.

The component for water heating was defined as all energy used to heat water
for hot running water, as well as water heated at point sources (such as
stoves or auxiliary water-heating equipment) for bathing, cleaning and other
noncooking applications of hot water.  Energy used at point sources to heat
water for cooking and hot drinks was considered part of the general appliance
component, as was energy used to heat water for a swimming pool, hot tub,
spa, or Jacuzzi. 

For electricity, end use estimates were also made for freezers, dishwashers, and clothes dryers.  The estimates are DOLELFRZ, DOLELDWH, and DOLELCDR.  DOLELAPL also includes these end uses, hence DOLELAPL equals the sum of DOLELFRZ, DOLELDWH, and DOLELCDR plus the expenditures for lights and other numerous appliances.  The electricity used in refrigerators is not included in DOLELAPL.  DOLELAPL includes all electricity expenditures except electricity use for space heating, water heating, air conditioning, and refrigerators.  This includes electricity used for freezers, cooking, dishwashers, clothes dryers, lights, TV's, VCR's, stereos, coffee makers, power tools, pool heaters, furnace fans, home computers, and many more uses.

          For the 1987 and subsequent RECS, the electricity regression equation
     assigned the electricity associated with the operation of fans in any
     central forced-air heating equipment was assigned to the electricity
     appliance component and not to the space-heating component.  Hence, if
     ELWARM = 0 then DOLELSPH = 0.
